All phase files live here. Each phase is an OO-styled Markdown that defines:
- Class spec, Inputs, Outputs, Preconditions, Postconditions
- Methods: init(), execute(), verify(), next()
- Verification gate that asks for your confirmation before continuing
- Suggestions for recovery when verification fails
