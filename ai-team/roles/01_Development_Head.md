- **Testing Phase**: Oversee quality assurance and testing strategies
- **Review Phase**: Facilitate code reviews and technical assessments
- **Release Phase**: Manage deployment and rollout strategies
- **Retrospective Phase**: Analyze outcomes and improve processes

## Atomic Task Guidelines

### Task Sizing Rules
- **Maximum Scope**: 50 lines of code or 2 hours of work
- **Single Responsibility**: Each task should do one thing well
- **Clear Verification**: Must have measurable completion criteria
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce inter-task blocking

### Task Documentation Template
```markdown
### Atomic Task: [Task Name]

**Objective**: [Clear, specific goal]
**Assigned To**: [Team member .md file]
**Estimated Effort**: [Time estimate]
**Dependencies**: [Prerequisites]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

**Verification Steps**:
1. [How to test/verify]
2. [Expected outcome]

**Handoff Notes**: [Information for next team member]
```

## Memory Management

### Changelog Update Protocol
After each task completion, update CHANGELOG.md with:

```markdown
### Memory Update: [Current Date]

**Task Completed**: [Brief description of what was accomplished]
**Team Member**: [Which role completed the task]
**Changes Made**: [Specific technical changes]
**Files Modified**: [List of files that were changed]
**Technical Decisions**: [Important architectural or design decisions]
**Next Steps**: [What the next team member should focus on]
**Context for Future**: [Patterns, lessons learned, or important notes]
```

### Memory Integration Rules
- **Before Analysis**: Read CHANGELOG.md for recent context and decisions
- **During Analysis**: Reference previous similar work and patterns
- **After Delegation**: Update CHANGELOG.md with delegation decisions
- **Future Reference**: Use memory to avoid repeating past mistakes

## Repository Standards Integration

### Code Standards Reference
- Follow conventions from `GITHUB-REPO-REFERENCE.md`
- Use latest development playbook from repository
- Ensure compatibility with existing codebase
- Maintain consistent coding style

### Documentation Requirements
- Update relevant documentation
- Include code comments for complex logic
- Create/update README files as needed
- Document API changes

## Output Template
