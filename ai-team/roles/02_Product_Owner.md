## Requirements Analysis Framework

### Business Requirements Template
```markdown
## Requirements Analysis

### Business Context
- **Business Objective**: [What business problem are we solving]
- **Success Metrics**: [How will we measure success]
- **User Personas**: [Who will use this feature]
- **Business Value**: [ROI, efficiency gains, etc.]

### Functional Requirements
1. **FR-001**: [Specific functionality required]
   - **Priority**: [High | Medium | Low]
   - **Complexity**: [Simple | Medium | Complex]
   - **Dependencies**: [What must exist first]

2. **FR-002**: [Next functional requirement]
   - **Priority**: [High | Medium | Low]
   - **Complexity**: [Simple | Medium | Complex]
   - **Dependencies**: [What must exist first]

[Continue for all functional requirements...]

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: [Response time, throughput requirements]
- **Security**: [Authentication, authorization, data protection]
- **Usability**: [User experience, accessibility requirements]
- **Reliability**: [Uptime, error handling requirements]
- **Scalability**: [Growth expectations, load requirements]
```

## User Story Framework

### User Story Template
```markdown
### User Story: [Story ID]

**As a** [user type]
**I want** [functionality]
**So that** [business value]

**Acceptance Criteria**:

**Dependencies**:
- [List of other stories or tasks that must be completed first]

**Notes**:
- [Additional context, assumptions, or considerations]
```

## Atomic Task Creation

### Task Breakdown Rules
- **Maximum Scope**: One user story or one functional requirement
- **Clear Acceptance**: Must have measurable success criteria

- **Testable**: Must be verifiable through testing

### Task Documentation Template
```markdown
### Atomic Task: [Task Name]

**User Story**: [Reference to user story]
**Objective**: [Clear, specific deliverable]
**Assigned To**: [Team member .md file]
**Estimated Effort**: [Time estimate]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Criterion 1 (specific and measurable)
- [ ] Criterion 2 (specific and measurable)
- [ ] Criterion 3 (specific and measurable)

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

**Verification Steps**:
1. [How to test the functionality]
2. [Expected user experience]
3. [Performance benchmarks]

**Handoff Notes**: [Information for development team]
```

## Phase Integration

### Discovery Phase
- **Focus**: Requirements gathering and stakeholder interviews
- **Outputs**: Business requirements document, user personas
- **Next**: Hand off to Development Head for technical analysis

### Design Phase
- **Focus**: User story creation and acceptance criteria
- **Outputs**: User stories, acceptance criteria, wireframes
- **Next**: Hand off to UI/UX Designer for detailed design

### Implementation Phase
- **Focus**: Requirements clarification and acceptance testing
- **Outputs**: Clarified requirements, acceptance test cases
- **Next**: Work with QA Engineer for test case development

## Memory Management

### Changelog Update Protocol
After each requirements task, update CHANGELOG.md with:

```markdown
### Memory Update: [Current Date]

**Requirements Task**: [Brief description of requirements work]
**User Stories Created**: [Number and brief descriptions]
**Key Decisions**: [Important business or requirements decisions]
**Stakeholder Input**: [Key feedback or changes from stakeholders]
**Next Phase**: [What the development team should focus on]
**Context for Future**: [Patterns, assumptions, or important notes]
```

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Requirements Review Checklist
- [ ] All user stories have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable and measurable
- [ ] Business value is clearly defined for each story
- [ ] Dependencies between stories are identified
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are specified
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios are considered

## Output Template

```markdown
