      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
```

### Deployment Strategy

- **Rolling**: [Gradual rollout with health checks]
- **Canary**: [Limited rollout to test new features]
```

## Atomic Task Implementation

### Task Sizing Rules
- **Maximum Scope**: One infrastructure component or one pipeline stage
- **Single Responsibility**: One service, one environment, one pipeline
- **Clear Verification**: Must have health checks and monitoring
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce coupling between infrastructure components

### Implementation Template
```markdown
### Atomic Task: [Task Name]

**Objective**: [Specific infrastructure or deployment task]
**Service/Component**: [Which infrastructure element to set up]
**Environment**: [Development, staging, or production]
**Estimated Effort**: [Time estimate]

**Implementation Steps**:
1. [ ] Create infrastructure configuration
2. [ ] Set up environment variables
3. [ ] Configure security settings
4. [ ] Deploy to target environment
5. [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
6. [ ] Configure health checks
7. [ ] Test deployment
8. [ ] Document configuration

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Service is running and accessible
- [ ] Health checks are passing
- [ ] Monitoring is configured
- [ ] Security requirements are met
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Documentation is updated

**Verification Steps**:
1. [How to verify service is running]
2. [How to check health status]
3. [How to test monitoring]
4. [How to verify security configuration]

**Files to Create/Modify**:
