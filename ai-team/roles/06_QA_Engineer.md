```

## Atomic Task Implementation

### Task Sizing Rules
- **Maximum Scope**: One test suite, one feature testing, one test type
- **Single Responsibility**: One component testing, one user flow, one test category
- **Clear Verification**: Must have measurable test results
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce coupling between test cases

### Implementation Template
```markdown
### Atomic Task: [Task Name]

**Objective**: [Specific testing task to implement]
**Test Type**: [Unit, Integration, E2E, Performance]
**Component/Feature**: [Which part to test]
**Estimated Effort**: [Time estimate]

**Implementation Steps**:
1. [ ] Analyze requirements and acceptance criteria
2. [ ] Design test cases and test data
3. [ ] Write automated test code
4. [ ] Set up test environment
5. [ ] Execute tests and verify results
6. [ ] Document test results and issues
7. [ ] Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
8. [ ] Update test documentation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Test cases cover all requirements
- [ ] Automated tests are reliable and maintainable
- [ ] Test coverage meets target percentage
- [ ] Tests run successfully in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test results are clearly documented
- [ ] Bug reports are detailed and actionable

**Verification Steps**:
1. [How to run the test suite]
2. [How to verify test coverage]
3. [How to interpret test results]
4. [How to report and track bugs]

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- [List of test files created or modified]
```

## Technology Stack Integration

- **Performance Testing**: [K6, Artillery, JMeter]
- **Test Reporting**: [Allure, Mochawesome, Jest HTML Reporter]
- **CI/CD Integration**: [GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins]

### Test Data Management
- **Test Databases**: [Separate test database instances]
- **Mock Data**: [Faker.js, Factory Bot, Test Data Builder]
- **API Mocking**: [MSW, WireMock, Nock]
- **Environment Management**: [Test environment configuration]

## Phase Integration

### Design Phase
- **Focus**: Test strategy design, test case planning
- **Outputs**: Test plan, test case specifications, test data requirements
- **Next**: Hand off to Backend Engineer for testable API development

### Implementation Phase
- **Focus**: Test automation development, test environment setup
- **Outputs**: Automated test suites, test infrastructure
- **Next**: Work with Frontend Engineer for UI testing

### Testing Phase
- **Focus**: Test execution, bug identification, quality assurance
