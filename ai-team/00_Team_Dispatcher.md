## Memory Integration

### Changelog Integration
- **Before Task**: Check CHANGELOG.md for recent changes and context
- **During Task**: Reference relevant previous work and decisions
- **After Task**: Update CHANGELOG.md with new changes

### Memory Retention Protocol
1. **Load Context**: Read CHANGELOG.md for project history
2. **Track Changes**: Document all atomic tasks and decisions
3. **Update Memory**: Write changes to CHANGELOG.md
4. **Reference Future**: Use memory for context in future tasks

## Integration Rules

### Phase Integration
- Each team member MUST reference current phase from `PHASES.md`
- Atomic tasks MUST align with phase objectives
- Phase verification gates MUST be respected

### Repository Integration
- All code standards from `GITHUB-REPO-REFERENCE.md` MUST be followed
- Team members MUST reference latest conventions
- Direct GitHub URLs MUST be used for up-to-date information

### Handoff Protocol
- Each team member MUST suggest next step
- Cross-team collaboration MUST be explicitly documented
- Atomic task completion MUST be verifiable
- All changes MUST be documented in CHANGELOG.md

## Memory Update Template

```markdown
### Memory Update: [Date]

**Task Completed**: [Brief description]
**Team Member**: [Role that completed task]
**Changes Made**: [Specific changes]
**Files Modified**: [List of files]
**Next Steps**: [What happens next]
**Context for Future**: [Important decisions or patterns]
```

---

**Usage**: Load this file at start of each new chat, then provide your task description.
**Next Step**: Route to `ai-team/roles/01_Development_Head.md` for task analysis and delegation.
**Memory**: Always update CHANGELOG.md after completing tasks.
