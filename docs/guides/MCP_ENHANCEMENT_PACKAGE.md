## üöÄ Agent Operational Enhancements & Best Practices

This section outlines critical operational improvements and best practices for the AI Agent, derived from project experiences.

### 1. **Markdown File Organization**
- **Improvement**: Consolidate all Markdown (`.md`) files into a dedicated `docs/` or `documentation/` folder at the project root.
- **Benefit**: Ensures a cleaner root directory, improves project navigability, and centralizes documentation efforts.

### 2. **Intelligent Development Server Management**
- **Improvement**: Before executing `npm run dev`, the agent should check if a development server is already running on the required ports.
  - If a server is detected, the agent should confirm its status and, if healthy, utilize the existing server.
  - If no server is running or the existing one is unhealthy/conflicting, the agent should gracefully terminate any potential lingering processes and then initiate a new `npm run dev` command.
- **Benefit**: Prevents port conflicts, reduces redundant server starts, and ensures a stable development environment.

### 3. **Automated Changelog & Readme Updates**
- **Improvement**: Prior to any Git push operation, the agent must automatically update `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` with the latest changes.
- **Mechanism**: Utilize the `get_datetime` tool to ensure accurate timestamps for these updates.
- **Benefit**: Maintains up-to-date project documentation, provides clear version history, and reduces manual overhead.

### 4. **Pre-Push Git Confirmation**
- **Improvement**: Before performing a `git push`, the agent must explicitly ask the user for confirmation.
- **Prompt**: "Should I proceed with pushing these changes to Git, or do you have any further modifications or issues to address?"
- **Benefit**: Provides the user with a final review opportunity, prevents unintended pushes, and ensures user control over the version control process.

### 5. **Explicit Mode Awareness**
- **Improvement**: The agent must always be aware of and, when relevant, explicitly state its current operational mode (e.g., "Ask Mode" or "Agent Mode").
- **Benefit**: Enhances transparency, helps the user understand the agent's current capabilities and limitations, and guides interaction.

### 6. **Standardized Response Prefix**
- **Improvement**: All agent responses must consistently begin with `[<LLM Name/Version>]`.
- **Benefit**: Clearly identifies the LLM model being used, aids in tracking model performance, and provides a consistent user experience.

### 7. **Dynamic LLM Token Management (Based on Cursor Documentation)**
- **Improvement**: When an auto-selected LLM is identified, the agent must dynamically adjust its internal token management based on that LLM's specific context window as provided in the Cursor documentation.
- **Token Limits by Model**:
  - **Ultra-High Capacity**: `o1` - 1,000,000 tokens
  - **Premium Tier (200k tokens)**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4o, o1-mini, Grok-2, DeepSeek R1
  - **Standard Models (40k tokens)**: cursor-small, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o Mini, o3-mini-high, DeepSeek V3
- **Pre-Response Check**: Before sending an answer, the agent should verify if the identified LLM is capable of reading and processing the `[<LLM Name/Version>]` prefix in its own output.
- **Benefit**: Optimizes token usage, prevents context window overflows, and ensures the agent operates within the technical constraints of the active LLM.

### 8. **Adaptive Auto Mode Behavior (Based on Cursor Pricing)**
- **Improvement**: The agent's behavior when operating in "Auto Mode" should be dynamically adjusted based on the latest information regarding Cursor's auto-LLM selection and pricing strategies from [Cursor's pricing documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/account/pricing#auto).
- **Auto Mode Considerations**:
  - **Dynamic Model Selection**: Auto mode intelligently chooses the best model for the task
  - **Cost Optimization**: Balances capability with cost efficiency
  - **Context Management**: Handles long conversations effectively
  - **Performance Optimization**: Adapts to conversation complexity
- **Benefit**: Ensures the agent aligns with the platform's intended auto-mode functionality, optimizes resource utilization, and potentially reduces operational costs.

### 9. **Enhanced Context Management for Different Token Limits**
- **40k Token Models**: Focus on atomic tasks, frequent context resets, minimal file attachments
- **200k Token Models**: Handle medium complexity projects, moderate context usage, selective file attachments
- **1M Token Models**: Manage large codebases, extensive context, comprehensive file analysis
